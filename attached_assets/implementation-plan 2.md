- **Authentication**: Auth0 or Firebase Authentication
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Hosting**: AWS, GCP, or Azure

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with Next.js
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Visualization**: D3.js or React-Force-Graph

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Development Environment
- GitHub repository with branch protection
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Docker containers for consistent environments

### Production Environment
- Auto-scaling capabilities for backend services
- CDN for static assets
- Monitoring and logging (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
- Regular database backups
- Rate limiting for LLM API usage

## API Design

### Core Endpoints

1. **Knowledge Graph API**
   - `GET /concepts` - List available concepts
   - `GET /concepts/:id` - Get concept details
   - `GET /concepts/:id/connections` - Get related concepts
   - `GET /concepts/:id/prerequisites` - Get prerequisites

2. **Learning API**
   - `POST /learn/:conceptId` - Mark concept as learned
   - `GET /user/knowledge` - Get user's knowledge state
   - `GET /user/recommendations` - Get recommended concepts to learn

3. **Chat API**
   - `POST /chat/:conceptId` - Send message to LLM about concept
   - `GET /chat/history/:conceptId` - Get chat history for concept

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Implement logging for all LLM interactions
- Track key metrics:
  - Concept discovery rate
  - Time spent per concept
  - Quiz performance
  - Chat engagement
  - User retention
- Create admin dashboard for system performance

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize user input before sending to LLM
- Set up rate limiting for API endpoints
- Regularly audit LLM outputs for inappropriate content
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

## Scaling Considerations

- Design with horizontal scaling in mind
- Implement caching strategies for LLM responses
- Use database read replicas for high traffic
- Consider edge deployment for global audience
- Plan for content moderation as user base grows

## Future Expansion (Post-Launch)

- Mobile application
- Offline mode support
- Integration with learning management systems
- API for third-party developers
- Enterprise version with private knowledge maps
- Content creation tools for educators

## Success Metrics

- User engagement (daily active users, session length)
- Learning outcomes (concepts mastered, quiz performance)
- User satisfaction (NPS, feedback scores)
- Growth metrics (user acquisition, retention)
- Technical metrics (response time, availability)

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM generates incorrect information | High | Implement fact-checking systems, clear feedback mechanisms |
| High LLM API costs | Medium | Optimize prompts, implement caching, consider fine-tuning |
| Knowledge graph inconsistencies | Medium | Regular validation by subject matter experts |
| Poor user engagement | High | Regular usability testing, analytics-driven improvements |
| Scaling issues with growth | Medium | Load testing, scalable architecture design |

## Next Steps

1. Finalize domain selection for MVP
2. Set up development environment and repositories
3. Begin knowledge graph design and implementation
4. Start LLM prompt engineering
5. Design initial UI mockups
